# Telco-Churn-Feature-Engineering

## Business Problem
It is desirable to develop a machine learning model that can predict customers who will leave the company. Before developing the model, necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps will be performed.

## About Dataset
### Context
"Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs." [IBM Sample Data Sets]

### Content
Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.

#### The data set includes information about:
- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
### Inspiration
To explore this type of models and learn more about the subject.

### About this file
The raw data contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features).
The “Churn” column is our target.


## The project was created by performing the following tasks.

- Explorer Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
